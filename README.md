# OOP Final Project
 Final Project for Object Oriented Programming

[Video Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAWzdO2xHvk)

**If you intend on utilizing this code for your own project, you may need to change the SQL server information as well as the SQL commands.**

Program has blank field protection measures in order to attempt to avoid crashing, not completely polished but is a good start. May update from time to time :)
